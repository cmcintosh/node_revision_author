This is a simple module that allows you to set the editor of a revision on an existing node to be the author of the node they are editing. This can be helpful in many situations to allow people to maintain ownership of a node after they have last edited it.

Installation:
Just enable the module in your Drual 7 site. Once enabled you will need to edit the Content Type and select the checkbox: Set Author to Node Revision Editor to enable the functionality on that content item.  This is found under the Publishing options tab.
